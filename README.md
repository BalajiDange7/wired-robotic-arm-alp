It deals with remotely controlled robotic arm to detect and handle material such as pick and place crane , The software program is to operate the one stepper motor and one dc motor. The insstruction to the robotic arm is provided from the keypad of transmitter circuit. The detection as well as on/off control is achieved for both the motors. Using stepper motor one can obtain any speed up to maximum speed this reduced the complex speed reduction system. The robotic arm is interfaced to microcontroller port, the stepper motor will do the task of arm movement which is installed on the basement. The dc motor is used to load and unload the materials. Belt, pulley arrangements are provided to handle the material. The two microcontroller units perform the task. The instructions to operate the motor is provided from keypad the order is initially encoded into some suitable form and equivalent control signals are applied to the RF transmitter which is working at 433MHz ASK. At the end RF ASK receiver will decode the received code, microcontroller will recognize it and send the appropriate control signals to the motor to operate the arm as per our requirement.
